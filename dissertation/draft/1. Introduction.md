2020年春季爆发的新型冠状病毒（新冠）疫情给全世界带来了广泛而深远的影响。截至WHO在2023年5月5日宣布新冠疫情“不再构成国际关注的突发公共卫生事件”，其已在世界范围内造成超过690万人死亡，同时引发了一个多世纪以来最严重的全球经济危机。

这其中，新冠疫情对世界范围内的交通行业带来的冲击尤为显著。在疫情爆发初期，世界各地都采取了限制出行的措施，以期减少人群接触，从而抑制新冠病毒的传播。这取得了一定的效果，但同时也对公共交通系统带来了毁灭性的打击——尽管只是暂时的。鉴于此，尽管有一些人选择了用主动出行（步行，骑自行车等）方式代替公共交通，但更多人选择采用私家车作为替代。这既违背了可持续交通的理念，也事实上加剧了出行中的不平等现象。

##  Research Objective
The objective of this dissertation is to investigate long term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the For-Hire Vehicle industry. Given the vastness and regional differences of the FHV industry worldwide, it is impractical to meticulously analyze the entire sector. As stated in (citation), case studies are powerful tools for addressing issues in social sciences. Therefore, a reasonable alternative is to select a suitable case for an in-depth study. Considering several factors, this research chooses New York City as the case for study. The specific research questions are: 
1. Has there been changes in the number of For-Hire Vehicles (FHV) in New York during the period of February to April 2023 compared to the same period in 2019?
2. If there have been changes, have these been evenly distributed temporally and spatially?
3. What are the main influencing factors for any changes?

## Study Area: New York City (NYC)
