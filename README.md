# UofG_MSc_Dissertation
> Author: Horace Wu

The project for dissertation of MSc Urabn Transport.

In this project, we mainly research on the following questions:
1. Have there been changes in the level of high volume for hire vehicles (HVFHV) in New York between the February 2019 time period and March 2023?
2. If there have been changes, have these been evenly distributed temporally and spatially?
3. What are the main influencing factors for any changes?


# Warning: The code of this project is Refactoring, if you find any bug/problem, please post Issue :)
